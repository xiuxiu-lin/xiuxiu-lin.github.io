## Working Papers

**Digitization and Product Quality: Evidence from India**
  
*Abstract*: This study explores the effects of digitization on product quality. Combining firm-product-level data on Indian manufacturing firms from 2001 to 2014 with a sectoral index that captures performance in Indian ICT service sectors used as inputs into manufacturing, I show that better access to ICT services, especially telecommunication service, has a positive and statistically significant effect on product quality. Mechanisms analysis indicates that access to ICT services impacts product quality upgrading by inducing manufacturing firms to use high-quality imported raw materials, outsource manufacturing jobs, and increase demand for managers.

**Services Liberalization and Firms' Environmental Performance: Evidence from India**
  
*Abstract*: This study examines the impact of services reform on the CO2 emission intensity of manufacturing firms in India for the period 1993-2005. My findings suggest that services liberalization led to significant reductions in CO2 emission intensity among manufacturing firms. This effect is larger for foreign-owned, large, and exporting firms. Furthermore, I show that services liberalization affects firms' CO2 emission intensity by improving their productivity.
