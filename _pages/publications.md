### Digitization, Product Quality and Geographic Proximity
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>

This study explores the effects of digitization on product quality. Combining firm-product-level data on Indian manufacturing firms from 2001 to 2014 with a sectoral index that captures performance in Indian ICT service sectors used as inputs into manufacturing, I show that better access to ICT services has a positive and statistically significant effect on product quality. This effect is larger for core products and for large firms. Access to digital services impacts product quality upgrading by inducing manufacturing firms to improve worker skills and outsource ICT services. Furthermore, geographic proximity to ICT suppliers is not essential for manufacturing firms to benefit from access to digital services.
